# Skin-Lesion-Segmentation-using-deep-learning
The project "Skin Lesion Segmentation Using Deep Learning" focuses on accurately identifying and segmenting skin lesions from dermoscopic images, a crucial step in early diagnosis of skin cancer. Utilizing advanced deep learning architectures like U-Net and Fully Convolutional Networks (FCN), the project implements robust models for pixel-wise segmentation of lesions. The U-Net architecture excels in handling medical imaging tasks due to its encoder-decoder structure, which captures both spatial and contextual information. Meanwhile, FCN ensures seamless end-to-end training for segmentation tasks by replacing fully connected layers with convolutional layers, enabling precise boundary detection. The PH2_resized dataset, enriched with annotated dermoscopic images, is used for model training and evaluation. Techniques like data augmentation, pre-processing, and post-processing are employed to enhance model accuracy. The project demonstrates the effectiveness of deep learning in medical image analysis, paving the way for automated diagnostic systems that assist dermatologists in detecting skin abnormalities efficiently.
